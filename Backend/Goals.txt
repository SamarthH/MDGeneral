So. here are some ways we get get this thing off the ground:

First thing:
    -Create a module to initiate all the variables(obivously based on inputs of the user)
    -Create a module to compute the forces as a function of positions and velocities.
    -Create a module to integrate. I suggest usage of the verlet's algorithm. It works well, and its quite similar to RK. It also works surprisingly well for a simulations~ 1 ns.
        Timesteps will be of the order of femtoseconds.
    -Create a module to sample. I'm not quite sure about this yet.

Primarty Goal:
    We first simulate an ideal gas, with periodic boundaries and randomly initiated velocities and no forces. The particles will just pass through each other,
    and are just point particles. We check if this follows maxwellian statistics(obviously). 
    Something we can try: Then we try to verify the ideal gas equation in terms of intrinsic variables i.e:
    P=\rho R T. So, we must write algorithm to calculate densities

    We must also scale down units and create a natural scaling for temperatures. Thatll be useful when we include interactions.

    We can then add hard sphere interactions with a cutoff radius.

    If this works, add an LJ interaction and see what happens.

    Then, we make some optimisations and assumptions for optimization. We will get there once the above has been implemented.

    For now the only thing we can do is set a temperature and seeing what happens. any other thing such as simulations in an ensemble will take time.
