Implementation of Potentials

Lennard Jones Potential: 

	Potential : U(r) = 4\epsilon*[(\frac{\sigma}{r})^12 - (\frac{\sigma}{r})^6] - U(r_cut) \n
	Force : F(r) = 24\epsilon*\frac{\sigma^6}{r^7}*[2(\frac{\sigma}{r})^6 - 1] \vu{r} \n

	Here, the constants vector is as follows: \n
	interaction_const[i][j][0] = \epsilon \n
	interaction_const[i][j][1] = \sigma \n
	interaction_const[i][j][2] = Cutoff radius/distance (r_cut) \n
	interaction_const[i][j][3] = Truncated Potential (etrunc) \n
	interaction_const[i][j][4] = \sigma^6 \n
	interaction_const[i][j][5] = Tail Energy (assuming constant distribution outside cutoff radius) \n
	 \n

Implementation of Thermostats

Anderson Thermostat:

	For this, a particle is given a speed from the gaussian distribution with 0 mean and \frac{k_{b}*T_{req}}{m} variance with a probability of \nu per unit time.  \n
	 \n
	Here, the constants vector is as follows: \n
	thermostat_const[i][0] = \nu \n
	thermostat_const[i][particletype + 1] = \f[ \sqrt{\frac{k_b*T_{req}}{M}} \f]
