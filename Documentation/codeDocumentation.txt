Implementation of Potentials

Lennard Jones Potential: 

	Potential : U(r) = 4\epsilon*[(\frac{\sigma}{r})^12 - (\frac{\sigma}{r})^6] - U(r_cut)
	Force : F(r) = 24\epsilon*\frac{\sigma^6}{r^7}*[2(\frac{\sigma}{r})^6 - 1] \vu{r}

	Here, the constants vector is as follows:
	interaction_const[i][j][0] = \epsilon
	interaction_const[i][j][1] = \sigma
	interaction_const[i][j][2] = Cutoff radius/distance (r_cut)
	interaction_const[i][j][3] = Truncated Potential (etrunc)
	interaction_const[i][j][4] = \sigma^6
	interaction_const[i][j][5] = Tail Energy (assuming constant distribution outside cutoff radius)

	Limitations :
	Beacause the truncation method has been used, this potential can only be used for upto 4 space dimensions


Implementation of Thermostats

Anderson Thermostat:

	For this, a particle is given a speed from the gaussian distribution with 0 mean and \frac{k_{b}*T_{req}}{m} variance with a probability of \nu per unit time. 

	Here, the constants vector is as follows:
	thermostat_const[i][0] = \nu
